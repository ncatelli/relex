# relex
A lexer generator for the first principles project.

## Grammar
The grammar can be found at [grammar.ebnf](./docs/grammar.ebnf) and is built around the excellent grammar from [kean](https://kean.blog). Generation can be done with [rr](https://githug.com/ncatelli/rr-docker.git).

## Acknowledgements
This was mostly for learning purposes and built heavily by reference from:

- the official [rust regex libraries](https://github.com/rust-lang/regex/)
- [kean](https://kean.blog).
